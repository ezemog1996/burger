### Description

This application is me applying skills I've learned in express, handlebards, and orm for sql. You can add any burger using the input field. When added, it is appended to the left side of the screen. You can click the devour button and it will be moved to the right side of the screen.

### Installation

This does not require installation. Simply visit http://arcane-brushlands-24215.herokuapp.com/

### Usage

This project was mainly created so I could practice using node, express, handlebar, and orm.

### Contributing

Contribute any way you'd like. Improve any part you feel like needs improvement.

### Tests

Go to arcane-brushlands-24215.herokuapp.com and order a burger by typing the name into the input field and clicking the "Add Burger" button. Click devour next to your burger on the left side of the screen. This will update the burger as devoured in the database and it will move to the left side of the screen. Refresh the page and everything should be in the same place.
